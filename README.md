# covid-checkin - a location based checkin app ready to run

## TL;DR

## about

### What it is

This repository contains a covid/corona related checkin app that allows users to checkin at a given location.
This may help in tracking the location of potentially infected persons at the given location.

It is full featured with a mobile focussed frontend
### History

Coming from a financial transactions background in spring 2020 we reckoned that there hasn't been any good checkin app in germany and that we have had a lot of the necessary ingredients neccessary to build one at hand. So we decided to create chckr.de (the original name of the 'product') in our spare time. It turned out that we had been a little late to the party and that other took the "covid checkin biz" more seriously. So we called it "an app" and stopped our efforts right after we finished this MVP like system.
