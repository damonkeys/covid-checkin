# Description

This folder contains the landingpage(s) for chckr

## What is a landingpage?

For chckr we define a landingpage as a static page with a single purpose: Make the visitor click the cta and fullfill the necessecary steps.

## What landingpages do we have?

Currently the only landingpage is the landingpage designed to get biz's interested in chckr and make a signup to the "i am interested in chckr" group.

It is located in the only subfolder 
> *initial-acquire-biz*

## How are landingpages created?

Our landinpages are plain html files that are compiled into a single executable with a little webserver serving the static files.
This makes it easy to create, build and automatically (re-)deploy the sites
