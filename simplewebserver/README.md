# Simple Web-Server

Very very very simple webserver for static websites (our React project) listening to a http-port because it runs behind the SSL-Proxy! Configuration of listening port will be done by setting an environment variable:
````
export SERVER_PORT=3000
````

Put all the files to serve in folder static.
